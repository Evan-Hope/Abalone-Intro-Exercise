# Abalone-Intro-Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to display my introductory knowledge of reading in a data set, appending a variable to the set, setting up a workflow, creating a recipe, splitting data into training and test sets, and creating a recipe using the training set to help create predictions of the age of an abalone.
